## R Markdown
## Overview

`"binomial"` is a package 
that simulates variations of binomial distributions.

* `bin_variable()` creates an object (of class `"binvar"`)


## Motivation

This package implements functions for
calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the
probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.


## Usage

```{r}
library(Workout3-Cameron-Mandley.R)
#Creates an object of type binvar
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
#Creates a summary of the object
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
#Utilizes a custom summary printing of the object
binsum1
```

```{r}

```



```{r}

```
